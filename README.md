# Static Website - Example Project (Electronics & Cybersecurity)

This repository contains a **basic and purely illustrative** static website.  
The content is **random and used only as an example** to demonstrate how to build a simple web page using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 📝 Description

This website is a **test layout**, loosely based on topics like electronics and cybersecurity.  
However, the content is not meant to be complete, accurate, or informative — it's just placeholder material to show how a static site might be structured.

## 🔗 Website Link

You can view the example at the following link:

*Please note: this is a mock-up created for demonstration purposes only.*

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML page with placeholder text and structure.
- `stile.css` – Basic stylesheet to define the look and layout.
- `Images/` – Folder with example images (e.g., electronics or cybersecurity-themed visuals).

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created **strictly for testing and learning**.  
It’s a simple example of how to build a **static website** using only HTML and CSS —  
no JavaScript, no backend, no interactivity.  

Use this as a starting point or reference for your own static site experiments!
